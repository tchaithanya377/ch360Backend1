- Each app exposes RESTful endpoints under its base prefix; list with `GET` on the collection to discover schemas.

Implementation guide
- Auth
  - Include HTTP header: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` after login.
  - Refresh token periodically using the refresh endpoint.
- Pagination
  - List endpoints default to page size 20. Use query `?page=` and `?page_size=`.
- Filtering & search
  - Many list endpoints accept filters via query params (e.g., `?status=ACTIVE`).
  - Some support search: `?search=term` and ordering: `?ordering=field`.
- Idempotency & retries
  - For create operations that may be retried, include a client-generated idempotency key header and handle 409 conflicts.
- Error handling
  - Standard DRF error format: HTTP 4xx/5xx with `{detail: ...}`.
- Rate limits
  - Token endpoints are rate-limited; backoff on 429.

Common curl examples
- Login
  curl -X POST $BASE/api/auth/token/ -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"user@example.com","password":"secret"}'
- List departments
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $BASE/api/v1/departments/
- Create announcement
  curl -X POST $BASE/api/v1/departments/announcements/ -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"department":"<uuid>","title":"Welcome","content":"Hi","announcement_type":"GENERAL"}'

Notes
- UUIDs are used for primary keys in most resources.
- Case-insensitive unique constraints on emails/identifiers prevent duplicates.
- For high throughput, prefer bulk endpoints where available and minimize N+1 calls.

Health & Metrics
- GET `/health/`, `/health/detailed/`, `/health/ready/`, `/health/alive/`
- GET `/metrics/app` â€“ application RPS and request/DB latency percentiles
