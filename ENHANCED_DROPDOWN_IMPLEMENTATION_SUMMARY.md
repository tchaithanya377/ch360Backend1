- **Time Range Validation**: Ensures end time is after start time
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents duplicate academic periods
- **Data Consistency**: Ensures semester belongs to selected academic year

### **ðŸŽ¯ Enhanced User Experience:**
- **Loading States**: Shows loading indicators while fetching data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Auto-population**: Automatically populates related fields when possible

3. User selects Course Section and Faculty
4. Form validates time conflicts and duration
5. Timetable Slot is created with proper relationships
```

### **3. Attendance Session Creation:**
```
1. User selects Academic Period
2. JavaScript filters Timetable Slots based on period
3. User selects Timetable Slot (auto-populates other fields)
4. Form validates datetime ranges
5. Attendance Session is created with proper relationships
```

### **4. Attendance Record Creation:**
```
1. User selects Attendance Session
2. JavaScript filters Students based on session's course section
3. User selects Student and marks attendance
